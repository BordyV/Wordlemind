        This game is <b>Mastermind</b> but on web.
        <br>
        The game is simple, you have to guess the combination of colors.
        <br>
        The combination is made of 4 colors and the game will check every turn if the combination is right.
        <br>
        The game will tell you with hint if the combination is right or wrong.
        <br>
        The game will end when you have guessed the right combination or you have tried to more times.
        <br>
